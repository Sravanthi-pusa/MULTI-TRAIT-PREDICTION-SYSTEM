# MULTI-TRAIT-PREDECTION-SYSTEM
📌 Project Description

This project focuses on predicting allele sequences using machine learning and bioinformatics techniques. By leveraging sequence data, the model can analyze genetic variations and predict alleles efficiently. This can be useful in genomics, personalized medicine, and evolutionary biology.

🚀 Features

Sequence Preprocessing: Converts raw DNA sequences into numerical features.

Machine Learning Models: Utilizes deep learning (LSTM, CNN, Transformer) or traditional ML (SVM, Random Forest) for prediction.

Data Processing: Supports FASTA, CSV, and other sequence formats.

Evaluation Metrics: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualization: Generates graphs for sequence distribution and model performance.
